Weather Test App

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 3.3.0

* Rails version 7.0.8

* Postgresql

* Bootstrap

* [API Documentation](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)

* You can run: `rspec spec` 

* Database initialization : `rails db/setup`

* User credentials : `text@example.com` / `password`

* Because of Accu Weather API limitations (50 calls / day), I save responses so I'm not making the same request twice.

* You need to add your `ACCU_WEATHER_API_KEY` within `.env` file. You need to register on [https://developer.accuweather.com/apis](https://developer.accuweather.com/apis) then follow the instructions. You need to ask for a `Core Weather Limited Trial` product.

* Run `rails server` and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
